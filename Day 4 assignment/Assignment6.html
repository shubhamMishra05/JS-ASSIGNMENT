    <h3> Question 6: Rewrite the function using "?" or "||"</h3>
    <p>Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number - ask them to input again.</p>
    <p>The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.</p>
    <p>Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There is no need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this task.</p>
       <br><br> 
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> For check the Result go in the console window.</p>
